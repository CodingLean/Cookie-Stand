      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Uncle Sam was a fisherman who loved his Cookies. After Passing, we realized what he loved so very dearly . His Cookies ! But he always seemed to go when he ate them. And when he woke up from being passed out we did it. We created the best Best Cookies in the land! He woke up with a 15lb Salmon with crumbs of the cookie drizzling from the spit in his mouth.. BOOM .. The Salmon Cookie store!
